# Linear-convolution
A fundamental operation applied on signals
convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions (f and g) that produces a third function expressing how the shape of one is modified by the other. The term convolution refers to both the result function and to the process of computing it.
It is defined as the integral of the product of the two functions after one is reversed and shifted. And the integral is evaluated for all values of shift, producing the convolution function.

For complex-valued functions f, g defined on the set Z of integers, the discrete convolution of f and g is given by

{\displaystyle (f*g)[n]=\sum _{m=-\infty }^{\infty }f[m]g[n-m],}{\displaystyle (f*g)[n]=\sum _{m=-\infty }^{\infty }f[m]g[n-m],}
